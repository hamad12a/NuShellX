    Fortran Console Application : "NuTRL" Project Overview
========================================================================

NuLnz and NuTRL share the same main program NuCoreX. The choice between the two versions
is made by a compiler directive !DEC$ DEFINE at the top  of the code. The two versions in 
NuLnz and NuTRL  folders have already been set. In your compiler flags you must name the exe
file either  NuLnz.exe or NuTRL.exe otherwise they will both be called NuCoreX.exe.
